## Git, GitHub & Common Keynotes
Git: Git is an open soure distributed version-control system.
GitHub: GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
Commit: It is a Git object, a snpsohot of our entire repository compressed into a SHA, Secure Hash Algorithm.
Branch: It a lightwiehgt movable pointer to a commit.
Clone: It a local version of a repository including all commits and branches.
Remote: It a common repository on GitHub that all team members use to exchnage their changes.
Fork: It is a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user.
Pull Request: It is a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews comments, integrated tests, and more. 
HEAD: It represents our current working directory, the HEAD pointer can be moved to different brances, tags, or commits when using git switch.

## Let's discuss some commands with a bit of explanations so it can be helpful 
## SETUP - Configure tooling
To configure the user information used across all local respositories.

1.1: git config --global user.name "Shiuli Basher"
- It will help set a name that is idenfitiable for credit when review version history.

1.2: git config --global user.email "mabasher01@gmail.com"
- It will hep st an email address that will be assoicated with each history marker.

1.3: git config --global color.ui auto
- It will hep set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing.

## SETUP & INIT
To configure informantion intializing and cloning repositories.
2. git init 
- It will initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.
- This command turns an existing directory into a new Git repository inside the folder that we are running this command. After using      the git init command, link the local repository to an empty GitHUb repository using the following command.
- A new repository or simply repo can either be created locally, or an existing repository can be cloned. 
- When a repository was initalized locally, we need to push it to GitHub afterwards.
3. git remote add origin [url]
- We must specify the remote repsitory for our local repository. The url points to a repository on GitHub.
4. git clone [url]
- It will retrieve/copy an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
- This command will clone or download a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits.

## The .gtignore File
Sometimes it may be a good idea to exclude files from being traked iwth Git. this is typically done in a special file named .gitignore. We can find helpful templates for .gitignore files at github.com/gihhub/gitignore.

## Stage & Snapshot
5. git status 
- It will show modified files in working directory staged for your next commit
6. git add [file_name] - git add commonand followed by file name
- It will add a file as it looks now to your next commit which is known as stage
7. git reset [file_name] - git reset followed by file name
- It will unstage a file while retaining the chnages in working directory
8. git diff 
- It will differentiate of what is chnaged but not staged
9. git diff --staged
- It will differentiate of what is staged but not yet committed
10. git commint -m "[any descriptive message]"
- It will commit your staged content  as a new commit snapshot

## Branch, Merge & Synchronize Changes
Isolating work in branches, chnaging context, and integrating chnages.
Synchronize our local repository with the remote repository on GitHub.com
11. git branch 
- It will list your branches  a * will apear next to the currently active branch
12. git branch [branch_name]
- It will create a new branch at the current commit.
13. git checkout
- It will switch to another branch and check it our into your working directory.
14. git merge [branch]
- It will merge the specified branch's history into the current one.
- This is usually done in pull request, but is an important Git operation.
- It combines remote tracking branches into current local branch
15. git branch -d [branch-name]
- It will delete the specified branch.
16. git fetch
- It downloads all history from the remote tracking branches.
17. git push 
- It uploads all local branch commits to GitHub.
18. git pull
- It updates our current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. 
- git pull command is a combination of git fetch and gti merge.

## Make Changes
Browse and inspect the evolution of project files
19. git log
- It will show all commits in the current branch's history.
- It will lists version history for the current branch.
20. git log --follow [file]
- It lists versiion history for a file, beyond renames (works only for a single file)
21. git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]
- It will shows content differences between two branches
22. git show [commit]
- it will output metadata and content chnages of the specified commit
23. git add [file]
- It will shanpshots the file i preparation for versioning.
24. git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
- it records file snapshots permanently in version history.

## Redo Commits
Erase mistakes and craft replacement history
25. git reset [commit]
- It undoes all commits after [commit], preserving chnages locally
26. git reset --hard [commit]
- It discard all history and chnages back to the specified commit
- It can have nasty side effects. If you need to chnage commits that exist on GitHub (the remote),
  proceed with caution. Additional help can be provided at github.community or by contacting support
